1. underlying ds for linked list,arraylist?
ArrayList is a resizable array implementation in java. The backing data structure of ArrayList is an array of Object class. When creating an ArrayList you can provide initial capacity then the array is declared with the given capacity. The default capacity value is 10.
Linked List contains a link element called first. Each link carries a data field(s) and a link field called next. Each link is linked with its next link using its next link. Last link carries a link as null to mark the end of the list. 

2. Advantages and disadvatages of array list?
Advantages -
• You can define ArrayList as re-sizable array. 

• Elements can be inserted at or deleted from a particular position. 

• ArrayList class has many methods to manipulate the stored objects. 

• If generics are not used, ArrayList can hold any type of objects. 

Disadvatages- 

A possible disadvantage of ArrayList is that it holds only object types and not primitive types (eg, int ). To use a primitive type in an ArrayList, put it inside an object or use of the wrapper classes (eg, Integer, Double, Character). 

3. What are iterators and cursors?
An iterator allows iteration of a container with no knowledge of the container itself. A cursor, on the other hand, allows iteration of a container as well but has implementation details specific to the container type, so it does keep a reference to the container.





4. what are list iterator,iterator,enumerator with code?
ListIterator is one of the four java cursors. It is a java iterator which is used to traverse all types of lists including ArrayList, Vector, LinkedList, Stack etc. 
An Iterator is an object that can be used to loop through collections, like ArrayList and HashSet. It is called an "iterator" because "iterating" is the technical term for looping. To use an Iterator, you must import it from the java.
Enumeration means a list of named constant. In Java, enumeration defines a class type. An Enumeration can have constructors, methods and instance variables. It is created using enum keyword. 

5. IndexoutofboundException and arrayIndexOutofboundexception is same?
IndexOutOfBoundsException is the super class of ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException (thrown when accessing invalid index in a array) and StringIndexOutOfBoundsException (thrown when accessing invalid index in a String). 

can finally be return without try catch?
You cannot have a catch or finally without a try block. If you don't want to handle an exception in your code, then declare them with a throws clause. 

6. Difference b/w comparable and comparator?
Comparable provides a single sorting sequence. In other words, we can sort the collection on the basis of a single element such as id, name, and price.
The Comparator provides multiple sorting sequences. In other words, we can sort the collection on the basis of multiple elements such as id, name, and price etc.
