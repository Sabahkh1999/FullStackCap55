Questions :

1.why the output is showing false?

ans. Here the mentioned return type is Boolean.Which is why the output False is only returned .

2.Difference between constructor and method?

ans. Constructor :
     Constructor does not return any value .
     Constructor is used to initialize an object.
     In case constructor is not present, a default constructor is provided by java compiler.
     Constructor should be of the same name as that of class.
     Method:
     Method may/may not return a value.
     Method may/may not return a value.
     No default method is provided.
     Method name should not be of the same name as that of class.

3.what are the other roles of jvm?
      
ans.The role of JVM is To permit Java programs to run on operating systems and any device.To manage and enhance program memory.

4. who gives default constructor?
ans. Jvm gives defaut constructor,The default constructor is used to provode the default values and this is done by the java compiler.

5.What is the difference between c and java access specifiers?
ans.There is no access specifires in c whereas there are 4 access modifiers in java.

6.who provides extra functions in main method?
ans.Packages and Libraries.

7.why string is passed in main method?
ans.By passing String arrays , we can pass all the necessary parameters like options/arguments related to the program in the form of String easily.

8.what happens if final keyword is applied on variable,class and method?
ans.If we initialize a variable with the final keyword, then we cannot modify its value.
    If we declare a method as final, then it cannot be overridden by any subclasses. 
    If we declare a class as final, we restrict the other classes to inherit or extend it.

9.Is java call by reference or call by value? 
ans.Java uses only call by value while passing reference variables as well. As reference points to same address of object, creating a copy of reference is of no harm.
