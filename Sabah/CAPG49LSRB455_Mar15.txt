1.why the output is showing false????
Ans: as the return type is mentioned boolean, no matter what, the false will only be returned.


2.difference between constructor and method?
Ans : Constructor is used to initialize an object whereas method is used to exhibits functionality of an object.

Constructors are invoked implicitly whereas methods are invoked explicitly.

Constructor does not return any value where the method may/may not return a value.

In case constructor is not present, a default constructor is provided by java compiler. In the case of a method, no default method is provided.

Constructor should be of the same name as that of class. Method name should not be of the same name as that of class.

5.What is the difference between c and java access specifiers?
Ans : there is no access specifires in c whereas there are four access modifiers in java.

6.why only jvm gives default constructor?
Ans : because the default constructor is used to provode the default values and this is done by the java compiler. the java compiler is the part of jvm.

7.who provides extra functions in main method??
Ans : the packages and libraries present in jvm.

8.why string is passed in main method?
Ans : Because by passing String arrays , we can pass all the necessary parameters like options/arguments related to the program in the form of String easily.

9.what happens if final keyword is applied on variable,class and method?
Ans : If we initialize a variable with the final keyword, then we cannot modify its value.
