1.................what is difference b/w constructor and fucntion in the class?
Ans:Constructor is used to initialize an object whereas method is used to exhibits functionality of an object.
Constructors are invoked implicitly whereas methods are invoked explicitly.

2.............who gives default constructor?
Ans: Even if we do not define any constructor explicitly, the compiler will automatically provide a default constructor implicitly. 2. Parameterized Constructors:
It is possible to pass arguments to constructors.
Typically, these arguments help initialize an object when it is created.

3...............why only jvm gives default constructor?
Ans:The Java compiler provides a default constructor if you don't have any constructor in a class. The method is not provided by the compiler in any case.
The constructor name must be same as the class name.
The method name may or may not be same as the class name.


4...............Is java pass by value or pass by reference ?
Ans:Java always passes parameter variables by value. 
Object variables in Java always point to the real object in the memory heap.
A mutable object's value can be changed when it is passed to a method.

6...............What is the difference between c and java access specifiers?

7............who provides extra functions in main method??
Ans : the packages and libraries present in jvm.

8.............why string is passed in main method?
Ans : Because by passing String arrays , we can pass all the necessary parameters like options/arguments related to the program in the form of String easily.

9.............what happens if final keyword is applied on variable,class and method?
Ans : If we initialize a variable with the final keyword, then we cannot modify its value.
